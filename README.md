# BookStore-Application

Collaborated with a team to develop a Java-based desktop application. This application facilitates book purchases for users and empowers administrators to manage book inventory, track updates, and maintain a customer database. The project leveraged JavaFX for the graphical user interface, implemented object-oriented programming principles to create book and customer entities, and incorporated the state design pattern for managing customer membership statuses.
